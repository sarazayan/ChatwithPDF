Artificial intelligence is already part  of our lives, slowly \\nshaping o ur society and business. It is everywhere, in on your smartphones, laptops, and cars. AI can increas e \\nproductivity, gain competitive advantage, compliment human intelligence. and reduce cost of oper ations. Businesses \\nof all types and sizes are considering artificial intelligence to solve their pro blems. The scope of AI in business \\ntransformation is constantly growing.  This paper provides an introduction on the applications of AI in business. \\nKey Words:  Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence in Business, Automation.  \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\n1. INTRODUCTION \\n \\nArtificial Intelligence may be regarded as any software program that depicts human intel ligence and consequently has \\nthe ability to engage in a humanlike activity. \\nAI tools can enhance decision-making abilities, allowing enterprises to perf orm increasingly complex tasks. They are \\nversatile tools that enable people to rethink how we integrate information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights \\nto improve decision making. \\n  Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming commonplace in our daily lives. It is now a household name.  Amazon’s \\nvirtual assistant Alexa may soon be in every home in America. AI is already disrupting virtually every business \\nprocess in every industry. \\nAI has become an important technology that supports daily social life and economic ac tivities. In recent years, AI has \\nattracted attention as a key for  economic growth in developed countries such the United States and United Kingdom \\nand developing countries such as China and India [1]. \\nArtificial intelligence (AI)  may be regarded as the intelligence that machines exhibit by imitating human behavior.  It \\nfocuses on machine learning and enabling software to solve problems in a manner simila r to human intelligence. For \\nexample, computers approve American Express purchases, diagnose faults for GE, and assign rooms for Holiday Inns. \\nVoice recognition, computer vision, and robotics all employ AI [2]. \\n \\n2. OVERVIEW ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE \\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most important global issues of the 21st cent ury. \\nThe modern field of artificial intelligence came into existence in 1956 when t he term “artificial intelligence” (AI) was \\ncoined by John McCarthy. AI is the branch of computer science that deals with designing intelligent computer  systems \\nthat mimic human intelligence. The ability of machines to process natural language, to learn, to plan makes it possible \\nfor new tasks to be performed by intelligent systems. The main purpose of AI is to mimic the cognitive function of \\nhuman beings and perform activities that would typically be performed by a human being . Without being taught by \\nhuman,  machines use their own experience to solve a problem. Although the original v ision for artificial intelligence ', metadata={'source': '/content/MultiplePDFs/Artificial_Intelligence_in_Business.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content=\"International Journal of Engineering Research And Advanced Technology, Vol.6, Issue 7, July-2020 \\n \\nwww.ijerat.com                                                                                                                                      Page 63 \\nDOI : 10.31695/IJERAT.2020.3625 was to simulate human intelligence, research effort has gradually shifted t o autonomous systems that compete with \\npeople. \\n    AI is stand-alone independent electronic entity that functions much like human expert . Today, AI is integrated into \\nour daily lives in several forms, such as personal assistants, automated mass transport ation, aviation, computer \\ngaming, facial recognition at passport control, voice recognition on virtual as sistants, driverless cars, companion \\nrobots, etc.  AI technologies are performing better and better at analyzing  data [3,4]. \\n  An important feature of AI technology is that is can be added to existing technolog ies. AI has benefited many areas \\nsuch chemistry and medicine, where routine diagnoses can initiated by AI-aided computers. It embraces a wide range \\nof disciplines such as computer science, engineering, chemistry, biology, physics, astronomy, neuroscience, and social \\nsciences. \\n  AI is not a single technology but a range of computational models and algorithms.  The m ajor disciplines in AI \\ninclude expert systems, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), mac hine learning, deep learning, natural \\nlanguage processing, computer vision, and robotics. The se computer-based tools or technologies that have been used \\nto achieve AI’s goals are  illustrated in Figure 1 [5] and explained as follow s  [6,7]: \\n\\uf0b7 Expert Systems : An expert system (ES) (or knowledge-based system) essentially embodies the knowledge  \\nand reasoning of human experts.   An ES enables computers to make decisions by interpreting data and \\nselecting between alternatives just as a human expert would do. It uses a technique k nown as rule-based \\ninference in which rules are used to process data. The main business application of AI  is in expert systems, \\nwhich assist human experts in solving difficult problems. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Neural Networks : These computer programs identify objects or recognize patterns after having been \\ntrained. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are parallel distributed systems consisting of processing units \\n(neurons) that calculate some mathematical functions. The ANN model represents nonl inear relationships \\nwhich are directly learned from the data being modeled.  Neural networks are being  explored for  healthcare \\napplications in imaging and diagnoses, risk analysis, lifestyle management and monito ring, health \\ninformation management, and virtual health assistance. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Natural Language Processors : For AI to be useful to us humans, it needs to be able to communicate with \\nus in our language. Computer programs that translate or interpret language as it i s spoken by normal people. \\nNLP techniques extract information from unstructured data such as clinical notes to supplement and enrich \\nstructured medical data. NLP includes applications such as speech recognition, text anal ysis, translation and \\nother goals related to language. There are two basic approaches to NLP: statisti cal and semantic [8]. NLP \\nallows for intelligent search engines, helpful chatbots, and accessibility for people who are visually impaired. \\n\\uf0b7 Robots:  These are computer-based programmable machines that have physical manipulators and senso rs. \\nRobots  have moved from science fiction to your local hospital. Today, robots perfo rm vital functions in \\nhomes, industries, outer space, hospitals, and on military instillations. In jobs with repe titive and monotonous \\nfunctions they might even completely replace humans.  Robotics and autonomous systems is reg arded as the \\nfourth industrial revolution. \\n\\uf0b7  Fuzzy Logic:  Reasoning based on imprecise or incomplete information in terms of a range of values rather \\nthan point estimates. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty in knowledge that simulat es human reasoning in \\nincomplete or fuzzy data. The fuzzy model is robust to parameter changes and tolerant to impression. \\n\\uf0b7 Machine Learning: Algorithms to make predictions and interpret data and “learn”, without static prog ram \\ninstructions.  ML is a statistical technique for ﬁtting models to data and training models with data.  ML \\nextracts features from input data by  constructing analytical data algorithm s and examines the features to \\ncreate predictive models. The most common ML algorithms are supervised learning, unsupervise d learning, \\nreinforcement learning, and deep learning. ML algorithms are a good fit for anti -malware solutions because \\nmachine learning is well suited to solve 'fuzzy' problems.  \\n\\uf0b7 Deep Learning : A subset of machine learning built on a deep hierarchy of layers, with each l ayer solving \\ndifferent pieces of a complex problem. It aims at increasing the capacity of supervise d and unsupervised \\nlearning algorithms for solving complex real-world problems by adding multiple pr ocessing layers.

The relationship between artificial \\nintelligence, machine learning, and deep learning is shown in Figure 3 [10 ]. \\n\\uf0b7 Data Mining:   This deals with the discovery of hidden patterns and new knowledge from large databases. \\nData mining exhibits a variety of algorithmic tools such as statistics, regre ssion models, neural networks, \\nfuzzy sets, and evolutionary models. \\n \\nEach AI tool has its own advantages.  Using a combination of these models, rather than a  single model, is \\nrecommended. AI technologies are drastically influencing the retail industry and cus tomer experience.  Some types of \\nartificial intelligence are predominant in business, while others are not. AI  systems are designed to make decisions \\nusing real-time data. They have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. \\n3. APPLICATIONS OF AI IN BUSINESS \\nAI adoption must be done with IT and the entire business working together. I t does not generally replace human \\nintelligence but serves as a supporting tool.  AI seems destined to profoundly impact all aspects of business. It is \\nwidely used in business applications such as marketing, finance, accounting, human resources, supply chain, \\nautomation, data analytics, and natural language processing. Some of these are explained as follows [11- 14]: \\n\\uf0b7 Marketing :  Marketing is one of the most notable areas of applications of A I. It may decide the next most \\neffective marketing strategy. AI helps to develop marketing strateg ies and execute them. One way AI is \\nmarketing products is through chatbots, which can help solve problems, suggest products/service s, and \\nsupport sales. These AI chatbots can understand natural language. Retailers will be able to use AI technology \\nto track shoppers in their stores and prevent theft. For example, Walmart has been using HANA to process \\nhigh volume of transaction records. \\n\\uf0b7 Finance : Investments in financial AI is growing as AI is increasingly being applied in financial institutions \\nsuch as banks and insurance companies. Some banks  use various AI tools to detect fraudulent a ctivity. Loan \\napplications  are now being processed by software that can take into account a varie ty of factors  such as \\ncreditworthiness, credit score and  background check. Fraud detection represents another  way AI is helpful in \\nfinancial systems since AI can discern fraudulent activities. \\n\\uf0b7 Accounting:  AI is redefining the job descriptions of all sectors of professions. Accounti ng is a discipline that \\ndeals with recording, analyzing, summarizing, and reporting  every business transact ion. Accounting can be \\ndivided into several parts based on the activity of the organization: financial ac counting, cost accounting, and \\nmanagement accounting.  The AI technology is revolutionizing the accounting field and al tering the roles of \\naccountants [15]. \\n\\uf0b7 Automation:   The future is gravitating towards automation with AI driving the force behind eliminating the \\nhuman error  from business operations.  AI can  help improve efficiency and save money by automating many \\ntasks.  Automation alleviates repetitive or dangerous tasks. The increasing penetrati on of AI and autonomous \\ndevices into many aspects of life is improving efficiency and response times. For exampl e, robotic process \\nautomation can produce amazing results in  accounting department. The Apptus eSales soluti on is designed to \\nautomate merchandising based on a predictive understanding of consumers.  AI in accounting will reduce \\nerrors and free up professionals from repetitive tasks. Business communication with customers can also be \\nautomated through online chats, email marketing, and social media. \\n\\uf0b7 Human Resources : AI can help human resources (HR) departments by making candidate screening and \\nrecruitment process easier. Chatbots can  be used to answer many commonly asked questi ons about company \\nmission, policies, and benefits.

There is a notable impact from using AI in their staffing and talent management operat ions. AI can \\nbe a powerful tool in the hiring process. \\n\\uf0b7 Intelligent Supply Chain: As consumer expectations continue to change, supply chains struggle to get the \\nright products to customers, when and where they need them, without impacting mar gins. AI enables a self-\\nlearning and self-optimizing supply chain model with real-time insights to deliver precision.  \\n\\uf0b7 Business Intelligence:  This may also be regarded as a collection of decision support technologies for t he \\nenterprise aimed at enabling professionals make better and faster decisions. The purpose of business \\nintelligence (BI) is to support better business decision-making [16]. The use  of AI and machine learning in BI \\nis helping business enterprises to pull out actionable insigh ts from complex data. Machine learning tools in \\nbusiness intelligence like the HANA will improve operational efficiency. BI chatbots are enabling decision \\nmaking by analyzing business data . AI has merged with BI applications in manufacturing \\nand industrial sectors.  Figure 4 shows a typical healthcare business intelligence [17 ]. \\n \\n These are just some of the examples of AI applications in business.   Other use s of AI in business include business \\nanalytics, chatbots and virtual assistance, fraud/crime detection, sales, R &D, e-commerce, advertising, customer \\nservice, talent selection and development, manufacturing, healthcare business,  nation al security, criminal justice, \\nlogistics,  transportation, and smart cities. \\n \\n4. BENEFIT S \\nMost business leaders are excited about incorporating AI into the company’s business fun ctions i n order to start \\nrealizing its extraordinary benefits.  Companies of all types and sizes are finding ways to use the right artificial \\nintelligence technology to save time and money. In order to meet evolving custom er expectations,  companies are \\nleveraging intelligent technologies to transform the way they operate. \\n  The business benefits of artificial intelligence are many. By deploying t he right AI technology, a business can enjoy \\nthe following benefits [18 ]: \\n\\uf0b7 Save time and money by automating routine or repetitive processes  \\n\\uf0b7 Reduce operational costs, increase efficiency, boost operational efficiency, and i mprove customer \\nexperience \\n\\uf0b7 Increase sales, detect fraud, improve human resources, and provide predictive analysis. \\n\\uf0b7 Increase productivity and operational efficiencies and drive revenue growth \\n\\uf0b7 Predict customer preferences and offer them better, personalized experience \\n\\uf0b7 Increase revenue by identifying and maximizing sales opportunities \\n\\uf0b7 Provide  competitor advantage and empowers businesses to identify new opportunities \\n\\uf0b7  \\n\\uf0b7 Enable companies to do things differently, enable better decision making, create more intelligent proces ses, \\nand generate insights \\n\\uf0b7 Augment rather than replace human capabilities \\n\\uf0b7 Improve personalized services and predict customer needs with remarkable accuracy \\n\\uf0b7 Enable businesses to work smarter and faster, doing more with less \\n\\uf0b7 Help customer service reps provide better support.  \\n\\uf0b7 Personalize learning and improve accuracy of knowledge worker \\n    \\nAI-based devices like chatbots and virtual assistants are on the rise.

CHALLENGES  \\nEvery new technology comes with risks.  As an emerging technology, AI   is changing at a fast pace and may present \\nsome unexpected challenges. Some of the challenges facing business AI include the following [19,20 ]. \\n\\uf0b7 Lack of familiarity:  Most people in business are not very familiar with  artificial intelli gence, what it is and \\nwhat it can do for them. In spite of this. AI is a technology that is transforming every walk  of life. \\n\\uf0b7 Misunderstanding:  AI is misunderstood by many, especially by the mainstream media. The media has \\noverpraised AI for techniques that are not new, and over-criticized it for overly optimis tic promises.  \\n\\uf0b7 Public Fear:  Everywhere you look, it seems AI is assisting and displacing human effort. There a re plenty \\nof doom and gloom predictions around AI. AI  offers both promise and peril as it revolutionizes the workplace.   \\nThere is a public fear around the world  particularly in the busin ess community that AI technology such as \\nrobots will overtake us and force humans into obsolescence. This fear is  considered unfounded by some.  For \\nsure, AI is nowhere near replacing humans,  but it will automate repetitive tasks and free us up to do more \\ncomplex tasks.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ethics:   There are  currently no standards concerning data access, data sharing, or data protect ion.  How \\nshould we promote data access? How do we guard against biased or unfair use of  data in algorithms? What \\ntypes of ethical principles are introduced through software programming? T o answer these and related \\nquestions may require an international body that will set the standards by which ethical dilemmas are \\nresolved. The IEEE Global Initiative has ethical guidelines for AI and autonomous systems. \\n\\uf0b7 Shortage of Workforce : Due to the fast-growing AI market, people with AI skills are in short supp ly. To \\nrealize the full capacity of AI, we need the right people and the right cultu re. Right now, there are shortages of \\ndata scientists, computer scientists, engineers, and software developers because students ar e not receiving \\ninstruction in AI skills. More emphasis should be put on STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering  and \\nmathematics). Not generating more people with these capabilities will limit AI development. \\n \\nWhile AI offers valuable benefits to businesses, implementation is usually expensive and time-consuming.    Overall,  \\nthe pros outweigh the cons.  \\n \\n6. CONCLUSION  \\nArtificial intelligence is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent  behavior. It \\nhas played a significant role in transforming the way business operate  today.   AI may well be a revolution in human \\naffairs because AI tools  will have substantial impact on the general public in the foreseeable future. Companies \\naround the globe are utilizing AI in order to thrive, provide better solutions to t heir clients, and create new sources of \\nbusiness value. \\n  We are in an era of AI.  It is evident that AI is driving powerful tr ansformations across a variety of industries. \\nBusiness managers may not fully understand AI technology, but they need understand what  it can do for their \\nbusiness. They should learn to integrate AI technology into multiple aspects of t heir business. To get the most out of \\nAI, data scientists must engage with business users to understand their needs and problem s.

Our prompt to \\nthe system:\\nWrite the opening paragraph for an article about \\nhow transformative generative AI will be for \\nbusiness, in the style of McKinsey & Company.\\nChatGPT’s response:\\nThe rise of generative AI has the potential to be \\na major game-changer for businesses. This \\ntechnology, which allows for the creation of original \\ncontent by learning from existing data, has the \\npower to revolutionize industries and transform \\nthe way companies operate. By enabling the \\nautomation of many tasks that were previously \\ndone by humans, generative AI has the potential to \\nincrease efficiency and productivity, reduce costs, \\nand open up new opportunities for growth. As such, \\nbusinesses that are able to effectively leverage \\nthe technology are likely to gain a significant \\ncompetitive advantage.\\nNot perfect but overwhelmingly impressive.\\nFor us and many executives we’ve spoken to \\nrecently, entering one prompt into ChatGPT, \\ndeveloped by OpenAI, was all it took to see the \\npower of generative AI. In the first five days of its \\nrelease, more than a million users logged into the \\nplatform to experience it for themselves. OpenAI’s \\nservers can barely keep up with demand, regularly \\nflashing a message that users need to return later \\nwhen server capacity frees up.\\nProducts like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, as \\nwell as the underlying AI models that power such \\nsystems (Stable Diffusion, DALL ·E 2, GPT-3, to \\nname a few), are taking technology into realms once \\nthought to be reserved for humans. With generative \\nAI, computers can now arguably exhibit creativity. \\nThey can produce original content in response to \\nqueries, drawing from data they’ve ingested and \\ninteractions with users. They can develop blogs, sketch package designs,  write computer code , or \\neven theorize on the reason for a production error.\\nThis latest class of generative AI systems has \\nemerged from foundation models—large-scale, \\ndeep learning models trained on massive, broad, \\nunstructured data sets (such as text and images) \\nthat cover many topics. Developers can adapt the \\nmodels for a wide range of use cases, with little \\nfine-tuning required for each task. For example, \\nGPT-3.5, the foundation model underlying ChatGPT, \\nhas also been used to translate text, and scientists \\nused an earlier version of GPT to create novel \\nprotein sequences. In this way, the power of these \\ncapabilities is accessible to all, including developers \\nwho lack specialized machine learning skills and, in \\nsome cases, people with no technical background. \\nUsing foundation models can also reduce the time \\nfor developing new AI applications  to a level rarely \\npossible before.\\nGenerative AI promises to make 2023 one of the \\nmost exciting years yet for AI. But as with every \\nnew technology, business leaders must proceed \\nwith eyes wide open, because the technology today \\npresents many ethical and practical challenges.\\nPushing further into human realms\\nMore than a decade ago, we wrote an article \\nin which we sorted economic activity into \\nthree buckets—production, transactions, and \\ninteractions—and examined the extent to which \\ntechnology had made inroads into each. Machines \\nand factory technologies transformed production \\nby augmenting and automating human labor during \\nthe Industrial Revolution more than 100 years ago, \\nand AI has further amped up efficiencies on the \\nmanufacturing floor. Transactions have undergone \\nmany technological iterations over approximately \\nthe same time frame, including most recently \\ndigitization and, frequently, automation.\\nUntil recently, interaction labor, such as customer \\nservice, has experienced the least mature \\ntechnological interventions. Generative AI is set to \\nchange that by undertaking interaction labor in a \\n2 Generative AI is here: How tools like ChatGPT could change your business', metadata={'source': '/content/MultiplePDFs/Mckinsey_HowAICanChangeyourBusiness.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='way that approximates human behavior closely and, \\nin some cases, imperceptibly. That’s not to say these \\ntools are intended to work without human input and \\nintervention. In many cases, they are most powerful \\nin combination with humans, augmenting their \\ncapabilities and enabling them to get work done \\nfaster and better.\\nGenerative AI is also pushing technology into a \\nrealm thought to be unique to the human mind: \\ncreativity. The technology leverages its inputs \\n(the data it has ingested and a user prompt) and \\nexperiences (interactions with users that help \\nit “learn” new information and what’s correct/\\nincorrect) to generate entirely new content. While \\ndinner table debates will rage for the foreseeable \\nfuture on whether this truly equates to creativity, \\nmost would likely agree that these tools stand to \\nunleash more creativity into the world by prompting \\nhumans with starter ideas.\\nBusiness uses abound\\nThese models are in the early days of scaling, but \\nwe’ve started seeing the first batch of applications \\nacross functions, including the following (exhibit):\\n —Marketing and sales —crafting personalized \\nmarketing, social media, and technical sales \\ncontent (including text, images, and video); \\ncreating assistants aligned to specific \\nbusinesses, such as retail\\n —Operations —generating task lists for efficient \\nexecution of a given activity\\n —IT/engineering —writing, documenting, and \\nreviewing code\\n —Risk and legal —answering complex \\nquestions, pulling from vast amounts of legal \\ndocumentation, and drafting and reviewing \\nannual reports\\n —R&D —accelerating drug discovery through \\nbetter understanding of diseases and discovery \\nof chemical structuresExcitement is warranted, but caution is \\nrequired\\nThe awe-inspiring results of generative AI might \\nmake it seem like a ready-set-go technology, \\nbut that’s not the case. Its nascency requires \\nexecutives to proceed with an abundance of caution. \\nTechnologists are still working out the kinks, and \\nplenty of practical and ethical issues remain open. \\nHere are just a few:\\n —Like humans, generative AI can be wrong. \\nChatGPT, for example, sometimes “hallucinates,” \\nmeaning it confidently generates entirely \\ninaccurate information in response to a user \\nquestion and has no built-in mechanism to \\nsignal this to the user or challenge the result. \\nFor example, we have observed instances when \\nthe tool was asked to create a short bio and it \\ngenerated several incorrect facts for the person, \\nsuch as listing the wrong educational institution.\\n —Filters are not yet effective enough to catch \\ninappropriate content. Users of an image-\\ngenerating application that can create avatars \\nfrom a person’s photo received avatar options \\nfrom the system that portrayed them nude, even \\nthough they had input appropriate photos of \\nthemselves.\\n —Systemic biases still need to be addressed. \\nThese systems draw from massive amounts of \\ndata that might include unwanted biases .\\n —Individual company norms and values aren’t \\nreflected.  Companies will need to adapt the \\ntechnology to incorporate their culture and \\nvalues, an exercise that requires technical \\nexpertise and computing power beyond what \\nsome companies may have ready access to.\\n —Intellectual-property questions are up for \\ndebate.

At Valeo, the reduction of CO 2 emissions has been central \\nto our strategy since 2010, and sales generated fro m technologies that help to reduce CO 2 emissions have grown \\n20-fold to around 10 billion euros in 2021. We inte nd to continue our efforts, with the aim of achievi ng carbon \\nneutrality by 2050 and reaching nearly half of this  objective by 2030.”  \\nOn the journey to carbon neutrality, 2030 is an imp ortant and fast-approaching milestone. By then, Val eo is \\ncommitted to reducing: \\n- emissions related to its operating activities by 75%*, from 1.1 million to 0.3 million metric tons o f CO 2 \\n(Scopes 1 and 2); \\n- emissions related to its supply chain by 15%*, fr om 9.5 million to 8.1 million metric tons of CO 2 (upstream \\nScope 3); \\n- emissions related to the end use of its products (Scope 3 downstream) by 15%*, from 39 million to \\n33.1 million metric tons of CO 2. This reduction is expected to rise to 50% when ta king into account \\nemissions avoided thanks to the Group’s electrifica tion technologies, with CO 2 emissions declining from \\n39 million to 19.5 million metric tons. \\nBy 2030, Valeo will have invested more than 400 mil lion euros in reducing emissions related to its ope rating \\nactivities (Scopes 1 and 2). These investments will  be used to upgrade the Group’s sites to enable the  current \\n100 most carbon-intensive facilities to become high -energy efficiency sites by 2030. Upgrades will inc lude the \\ndevelopment of eco-friendly buildings, the widespre ad use of LED lighting and the integration of heat recovery \\nsystems.  \\nThe proportion of low-carbon energy in the Group's energy consumption will increase from 5.5% in 2019 to 80% \\nby 2030, having already risen to 50% by 2025. A num ber of sites are already piloting renewable energy \\nalternatives, including three Group sites in Chenna i (India), where 90% of consumption is wind-powered , and sites \\nin Sanand (India) and Bad Rodach (Germany), which u se their own solar energy facilities to produce 30%  and \\n20% of the energy they consume, respectively.  \\nValeo has also set the same CO 2 emissions reduction objectives for its suppliers, and the use of low-emission \\nmaterials will be increased. \", metadata={'source': '/content/MultiplePDFs/2021_02_04_PR_Carbon_Neutrality_objectives.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='  At the same time, Valeo will continue to expand its  portfolio of technologies that contribute to low-c arbon mobility, in \\nparticular its solutions for vehicle electrificatio n, a field in which the Group is currently world le ader.
